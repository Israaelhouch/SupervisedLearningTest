Build a model which predicts sales based on the money spent on different platforms for marketing.
Do data exploration and cleaning if needed, plot needed plots to find out which features correlate more with the sales and fit a linear regression model with the chosen feature as input and sales as output.
Use a fitting metric of evaluation for you model.
Implement Cross-Validation to evaluate your model.
 
Focus on clean code and correct implementation and don't forget the exploration phase.
